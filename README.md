# 🚀 My React.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my React.js learning journal!  
This repository documents my step-by-step progress as I explore and practice React concepts — from the basics to advanced topics.

---

## 📚 Episodes

- [Episode 1](./epi_1) → **Getting Started with React**

  - **epi_1.1** → Three ways to add an `<h1>`:
    1. Manually inside HTML
    2. Dynamically with Vanilla JS (`document.createElement`)
    3. Preparing React setup via CDN
  - **epi_1.2** → First React code:
    - Using `React.createElement` to build an `<h1>`
    - Rendering with `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()`
    - **epi_1.3** → Separating concerns:
    - Moved React code to a separate **`app.js`** file
    - Added external **`style.css`** for styling
    - Wrote cleaner, modular code (HTML + JS + CSS separated)
    - **epi_1.4** → Nested & sibling elements:
    - Built nested elements using `React.createElement`
    - Added multiple siblings inside a parent
    - Observed how verbose and hard-to-read core React code becomes
    - Motivation for moving towards **JSX**

- (More episodes coming soon...)

## 🎯 Goals of This Repo

- Keep track of my React learning journey
